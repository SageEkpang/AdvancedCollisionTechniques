## Project Overview:
This project is to show the different collision techniques and physics techniques that are employed in different physics engines. 
This project will showcase different physics scenes that will be able to be interacted with in some capticity with allowing for different inputs to be processed by the software.
Furthermore, this project will be to show my proficiency in the capacity of physics and collision detection with the employement of the optimisation techniques and the unique collision detection techniques present

## Project Aims:
* **Create differing physics scenes to showcase different collision detection and optimisation techniques**
* **Simple Collision Detection**
* **Complex Collision Detection**
* **Rigidbody Collision Detection**
* **Code Optimisation**
* **Physics Optimisation**
* **Collision Detection Optimisation**

## Problem being Solved?:
This is project is less a problem solving and more so an investigation into pre-existing collision and physics implementation within the world of game media. There are lot of physics simulations and they each 
handle physics in different ways and each showcase physics different. What I try to aim for is to explore the different techniques and come to my own conclusions of how to properly handle physics and collision within
a simulation. Due to time constraints and knowledge, the physics simulation may not be as intensive or exploratory as other physics simulations however, it will explore some of the techniques that other simulations use
and present these ideas. Furthermore, this project was created to be a Dissertation Artefact for my Final Year Project. I will add more to the content at later dates.

## Reasons for making this project:
* **Creating a Dissertation Artefact**
* **Exploring different Advanced Collision Techniques/engine**
* **Exploring physics optimisations within a physics simulation/engine**
* **Exploring collision optimisations within a physics simulation/engine**
* **Exploring code optimisations within a physics simulation/engine**
* **Exploring some Object Component System (OCS/ECS) techniques within a physics simulation/engine**

## How to use Project?:
*To be Added*



## Software Used:
* **DirectX**: Rendering and Coding the physics and collision interactions
* **Maya**: Model Creation for the Complex and Rigidbody Collision
