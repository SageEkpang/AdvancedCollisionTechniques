## Project Overview:
This project is to show the different collision techniques and physics techniques that are employed in different physics engines. 
This project will showcase different physics scenes that will be able to be interacted with in some capticity with allowing for different inputs to be processed by the software.
Furthermore, this project will be to show my proficiency in the capacity of physics and collision detection with the employement of the optimisation techniques and the unique collision detection techniques present

## Project Aims:
* **Create differing physics scenes to showcase different collision detection and optimisation techniques**
